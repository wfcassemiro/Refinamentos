The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on a project named TRANSLATORS101. Initially, there was a significant misunderstanding: the AI operated in a default FastAPI/React/MongoDB environment, while the user's project is a live application built with PHP and MySQL.

After clarification, the workflow was established: the user provides PHP files from a GitHub repository, specifies modifications, and the AI delivers the updated files.

The first major task was debugging a 500 Internal Server Error on the  page, triggered when editing an upcoming lecture. The AI's initial hypothesis of an incorrect file path was wrong. After the user provided the database schema, the AI correctly identified the root cause: a missing  column in the  table.

The fix for the 500 error led to a new problem: the edit button became inoperant without throwing console errors. The AI diagnosed this as a JavaScript event listener issue. By creating a script to dynamically re-attach listeners (), the functionality was restored.

Subsequently, the user requested UI improvements for the edit modal to match an Apple Vision style and the addition of a time input field.

The most recent task involves adding a dynamic Agenda T101 section to the live stream page (), which includes generating and downloading  calendar files for each lecture. The AI was about to begin this implementation.

<product_requirements>
The project, TRANSLATORS101, is an existing, fully functional web application for translators, built on a PHP and MySQL stack. The platform serves as an intelligent video library for lectures, featuring functionalities like a user watchlist, certificate generation, and user profiles.

The user's goal is not to build the application from scratch but to perform a series of refinements and bug fixes on the live system. The work so far has focused on:
1.  **Bug Fix:** Correcting a critical bug that prevented administrators from editing Upcoming Lectures. This involved a multi-step debugging process to fix a 500 Internal Server Error (caused by a missing database column) and a subsequent JavaScript issue where the edit button was unresponsive.
2.  **UI/UX Enhancement:** Modernizing the UI of the lecture editing modal to match the site's Apple Vision aesthetic and adding a new field for setting the lecture time.
3.  **New Feature Integration:** Displaying the upcoming lectures on the live stream page, making the data dynamic, and adding functionality for users to download an  calendar invite for each event.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL/MariaDB
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Debugging Process:** Iterative diagnosis of a 500 Internal Server Error by analyzing PHP code, server responses, and database schemas.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Resolving issues with inoperative buttons by dynamically re-attaching  event listeners.
- **Calendar Integration:** Server-side generation of  (iCalendar) files using PHP to allow users to add events to their personal calendars.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monolithic PHP project. The code is not structured within a formal MVC framework, with PHP files handling both logic and presentation, and JavaScript embedded directly or included in separate files for client-side interactivity.

**Directory Structure (from Git Repo):**


**Key Files Modified/Created:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the backend API endpoint responsible for handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for upcoming lectures. It's called via AJAX from the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Initially, the file was causing a 500 error. It was corrected to handle a missing  column in the database, ensuring it could fetch lecture data without crashing. The file path for  was also validated.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main landing page of the application. It contains the user-facing list of Próximas palestras and the HTML/JavaScript for the editing modal.
    -   **Changes:** The file was edited to include a new JavaScript file () to solve the unresponsive button issue. Later, it was significantly modified to restyle the editing modal with an Apple Vision theme and add a new input field for the lecture time.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new JavaScript file created to solve the core issue of the edit buttons not firing.
    -   **Summary:** This script iterates through all edit buttons on the page, removes any potentially problematic existing event listeners, and attaches a new, clean  listener that correctly calls the  function. This provided a permanent solution to the bug.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The live stream page. The user wants to add a new dynamic section to this page.
    -   **Changes:** This file is the subject of the current work. It will be modified to include a new Agenda T101 section that fetches and displays upcoming lectures and provides buttons for downloading  calendar files.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
The user provided an extensive roadmap of potential future features, grouped by priority. While not explicitly requested for immediate action, the following high-priority items are pending:
- **Notification System:** Reminders for watchlist items, new lecture alerts, and certificate availability.
- **Progress Tracking System:** Visual progress bars for lectures and a continue watching feature.
- **Gamification:** A points and achievement system to increase user engagement.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of implementing a new feature on the live stream page, . The user provided the file and a detailed set of requirements.

**The task is to:**
1.  **Create a new section titled Agenda T101** within the Próximas transmissões area of .
2.  **Dynamically fetch and display** the list of upcoming lectures, ensuring the content is identical to the landing page and updates automatically when the source data changes. This section must be read-only, without any edit or delete controls.
3.  **Add an instructional text:** Baixe o arquivo de convite e clique nele para incluir o evento em sua agenda. directly above the lecture list.
4.  **Implement an ICS file generator:** For each lecture listed, there must be a button that, when clicked, generates and downloads an  (iCalendar) file.
5.  **Populate the ICS file** with the lecture's title, description, speaker's name, and a 30-minute reminder before the event's start time.
6.  **Integrate the admin-defined live stream embed code:** The video player on this page must use the embed code specified in the  panel.

The AI engineer has acknowledged all requirements and was about to create the modified  file containing all the requested PHP and HTML logic.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create the updated  file, which will include the PHP logic to fetch lecture data from the database and the frontend code to display the Agenda T101 section with functional  download buttons.
